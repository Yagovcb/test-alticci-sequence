Calculator Alticci Sequence (Backend)
</h1>
<br>

## ðŸ’¬ About the repository

The Alticci Sequence Calculator calculates an Alticci sequence value based on a passed index, which is defined as follows:

n=0 => a(0) = 0

n=1 => a(1) = 1

n=2 => a(2) = 1

n>2 => a(n) = a(n-3) + a(n-2)

The core service takes advantage of past calculations to speed up future calculations through caching (using memoization). In addition to the main service, there is also a service by Spring Cache, to demonstrate the performance difference when memoization is not used.

## âš  Pre Requirements for project execution

* Java 11 or higher versions
* Maven

## ðŸ“Œ How to user?

To run the project, enter the following command in the root directory:

```
mvn spring-boot:run 
```

After building the application, access the [Swagger](http://localhost:8099/swagger-ui/index.html#/) to test the endpoints.

## âš  Super Important

This API has an updated Spring Security configuration and is ready to be coupled with the front-end. The authentication methodology is through Barear tokens with JWT encoding.

To simplify the process, we are using an H2 database in memory with a previously registered user, this user's information is located in the components folder, in the config folder.

To generate a JWT token, direct the request with username and password, in JSON format, to the following endpoint:

```
POST http://localhost:8099/login
```

That said, we can proceed!

## ðŸ“² Services available for testing
